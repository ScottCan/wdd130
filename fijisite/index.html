                <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Scott Cannegieter and I love Fiji. On this website, you will find pictures and descriptions about my time in Fiji as well as how to say some basic words and phrases in the Fijian language. I have made this website primarily for two reasons: so that I can easily show to my friends and family some information about Fiji, and so that I can journal some pictures and some of the things that I learned while I was there.</p>
            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Over three years ago in of July 2019, I moved to Fiji to serve my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I lived there until April of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic made it so that missionaries from around the world needed to return home. Although I was only there for about nine months, the experiences that I had and the lessons that I learned have changed my life forever. I often find myself looking over the pictures that I took and thinking of all of the memories that I had teaching there and learning the language.</p>
