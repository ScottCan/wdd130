        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Over three years ago in of July 2019, I moved to Fiji to serve my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I lived there until April of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic made it so that missionaries from around the world needed to return home. Although I was only there for about nine months, the experiences that I had and the lessons that I learned have changed my life forever. I often find myself looking over the pictures that I took and thinking of all of the memories that I had teaching there and learning the language. That is why I am making this website the perfect guide to show a little bit of what Fiji looks like as well as teach some Fijian. This website is made for all of my friends and family, anyone who may be going to Fiji for a trip or a mission, as well as anyone and everyone who is curious to learn about my experience. I am also making this website for myself so that I can journal some of my favorite pictures and phrases from the language. I think that there are many misconceptions about Fiji, and I hope to help correct them. Many people do not know much about this country, if anything, and I am always trying to share what I know with others. This website is a great all in one place to share many things that I learned and give others an idea of what my experience was like.

      <h3>Fijian Language</h3>
      <p>
        Fijian is a beautiful language that is unlike anything that you have heard before. While everyone knows about the common languages in the world such as Spanish or French, most people that I tell about Fiji never even knew that there was a language called Fijian! In fact, I did not know that this was a language at all until I read it on my mission. Over the course of the nine months that I was there, I grew to love this language and have always wanted to share about it with others. On this page I will write many words and phrases that I learned and found useful from my time. I would love to raise awareness and understanding of how this language works. My dream is that for everyone in my life to know how to say simple phrases in Fijian, just as they do with languages such as Spanish. This is also a special project for me, as I am doing my best to remember everything about the language that I learned, and this website is a great way for me to practice it.

      <h3>Areas in Fiji</h3>
      <p>
        When I was in Fiji I served in three very different locations. On this page I have pictures and information about all three areas: Makoi, Labasa, and Tukavesi. These areas spread across two different islands and ranged from cities to jungles. I was able to see very different locations and scenery, and I love sharing the many pictures that I took. These pictures and descriptions are how I can simply show how much I loved this place and why it means so much to me. On this page I will also include some maps to show where these areas are, as well as geological information of where Fiji is. Everyone knows that Fiji is an island in the ocean, but many people that I have met would not be able to point out Fiji on map. This page will include a section showing where Fiji is on a map, as well as marking where each of the areas are.
